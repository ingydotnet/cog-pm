NAME
    CogWiki - Turn Anything into a Wiki

SYNOPSIS
        > cd content/dir
        > cogwiki init
        > edit .wiki/config.yaml
        > cogwiki make
        > cogwiki up

DESCRIPTION
    CogWiki lets you turn any directory on your computer into a wiki. Every
    file in the directory is a wiki page. All CogWiki files are put into a
    ".wiki/" subdirectory. CogWiki uses git for wiki history. If your
    directory is already a git repo, CogWiki can use its GIT_DIR, or it can
    set up its own. CogWiki is a Perl PSGI program, so you can run it in any
    web environment. The 'up' command will start a local web server that you
    can use immediately (even offline).

    CogWiki installs a command line utility called "cogwiki". This command
    can be used to create and update the wiki. It can also act as a git hook
    command.
